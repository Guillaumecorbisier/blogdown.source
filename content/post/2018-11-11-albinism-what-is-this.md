**Albino in human and animals society,research about it and some devellopement**

# What is albinism ?

It ‘s a hereditary anomaly who cause a problem in pigmentation and a white aspect because the individu have lost his production in melanine.
The anomaly touch reptil, birds, amphibian, mamal, fish and plant and make completely the albino white even if he have a normal number of  melanocytes or pigments cell.

But that’s not all the albino is very affected by the light, the UV present in the light can cause burned an cancer of the skin normal people are not touched with the protection of the melanocyte and the constant reparation of the ADN.Albino have a déoloration of the iris too and a deformation of the retina,the gene responable of albinism is a recesif gene.

## Physiologic point

Pigmentation is controled by two type of cell : keratynocyte who stock melanine and melanococyte who product it.
Melanocytes make melanine in organites and melanosome are transfert in keratinocytes who are transported to the surface of the epiderm.For black people melanosme are isolated but witha high density at the opposite of the other.
3 type of melanocyte exist in the epiderm, eye and hair, These three types is managed by different gene and mutation can cause modification.

# Albino in society

# Desavantage of the albino for animal
This desavantages cause a selection important in the animal world the white fur cause reject in the group (animal don’t like other different animal) so reproduction is very difficult and this is hard to survive lonely for many species of animal but albino is sometimes less hunt by the predator because they think the albino is ill and not really good to eat but with white fur the albino don’t have any cameo and are more easily catchable in a normal biome. Advandages and incoveniants are not very balanced and the problem of rejection, cameo and cancer with the contact of the light on their skin make a big selection i hope find one time a population of albino to make some research and discover many explication.
