# Genomic
Color blindness is a mutation that can cause ,like the name says, a malformation of the iris who is involve in colour perception. This anomaly is a modification on the X chromosm who are hedetary. The mutation is gived to the child like a typical recesive ill on the X chromosm. A male mutant can't give is anomaly to his son because he give Y chromosm to him. And a female affected by the ill will give it to his son 100% chance of time.Female people have less chance to be colorblind because they have 2 X chromosm and the mutation is recessive so all the parents need to carry the mutant X chromosm to have a colorblind daughter

# Detection
- Isharah test: it's a test with many panel of different color and number in this panel. 

- Holmgren test: colorblind people have to combinate theard of wheel on a grey background 

- Nagel anormaloscope: two circle of color assembled to form one other, the colorblind people have to ajust the circle to make them look like a picture and can add blue,red or green to make it. 

- Fansworth test: a test with 15 or 85 token with color on them the patient have to classified the token gradualy by using the variance of colour.The classication have to begin with blue and have to go to red.

# Type of colorblindness
It exist three light and one heavy type of colorblidness.
- Acromatopsy: can not seen any color
- Deuteranopian: people who cant see green. 
- Protanopian: people who cant see red.
- Tritanopian: people who cant blue.
All mutation are caused by a lost of color receptor in the eye.
